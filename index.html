    <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
    <p>
      A California sea lion has a fusiform body shape that is sleek and
      streamlined. Male California sea lions reach about 2 to 2.5 m (6.5–8 ft.)
      and 200 to 400 kg (440–880 lbs.). At maturity male California sea lions
      are much larger than females. Female California sea lions reach about 1.5
      to 2 m (5–6.5 ft.) and 50 to 110 kg (110–240 lbs.). California sea lion
      coat colors vary. Generally, adult males are chocolate brown, females and
      young males are tan, and pups are dark chocolate brown. As adult males
      age, the hair around their heads lightens to a light tan. Most California
      sea lions appear dark brown to black when wet.

      A California sea lion's foreflippers are large and winglike. The
      foreflippers have all the major skeletal elements of the forelimbs of land
      mammals, but they are modified for swimming. The "arm" bones are
      shortened, and the flippers are lengthened by cartilaginous extensions at
      the tips of the finger bones. The first digit is larger than the others.
      It's strengthened by fibrous tissue along the leading edge. There are no
      claws or hair on the foreflippers. California sea lions use their
      foreflippers in an up-and-down, wing-like motion to propel themselves
      through the water.

      Like land mammals, sea lions have five digits in the hind limbs. They are
      lengthened by cartilaginous extensions. Nails are visible on the middle
      three digits. On land, a sea lion can rotate its hind flippers underneath
      the pelvic girdle, enabling it to support its weight and walk on all
      fours. In the water, a sea lion extends its hind flippers and uses them to
      help steer.
